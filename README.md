# 👋 Hi, I'm Zarish Baloch

I'm an Electrical Engineer who moved into IT and now works as a **Junior DevOps Engineer**.
I gained most of my current experience during my role at PTCL, where I worked with systems, data, and automation tools.

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools I’ve Used
- **Linux** – basic commands and scripting
- **MySQL** – basic queries and data handling
- **Grafana** – dashboards for monitoring
- **SAP** – user-level work in enterprise systems
- **MATLAB**, **ArcGIS**, **Telecom Systems** – from engineering and project experience

---

### 🎯 Current Focus
I’m continuing to apply what I’ve learned on the job and slowly building my foundation in DevOps through hands-on experience.
